This page is supposed to be some information about the guy whose ramblings you are reading.  Can't say I have honestly ever given thought about describing myself
beyond what you see in the blog header.

### Basic History

Graduated high school in Irving TX back in 1993, grew up most of my life there.  Went into the Army between 2 wars so served in peace time really.  Spent 2 months at Fort Sill in OK, 4 more months at Fort Gordon GA, and the rest of the 3 year term at Fort Hood TX.  So much for seeing the world in the military.

From there, it was marriage and kids.  Went to work eventually at GTE, which would later become Verizon.  Then finally Clearview, which would become API Healthcare, then swallowed up by GE.  That gets us to today.
