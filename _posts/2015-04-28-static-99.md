As a veteran in the United States, I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution.  This to me also applies to the values we were founded on.  One of those values is that it is better to let guilty men go free than to convict an innocent man.  I believe that [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/) should remain fiction, that you can't deny someone their basic rights because they might commit a crime.  The reality is that we given the right situation we all might commit a crime, according to some, the average person commits [3 felonies a day](http://www.threefeloniesaday.com/Youtoo/tabid/86/Default.aspx)!

Where am I going with this?  We are headed to a Minority Report style world and it is being ignored.  We are constantly improving ways to determine what someone will do in the future, from genetics to brain scans to current behavior.  This could in theory be a good thing, for instance, to assist someone in a preventative way.  A teenager that shows a tendency towards arson could be counselled to prevent that potential future.  But therein lies the problem with this, it is a potential problem.  Do we force something on someone based on a statistical analysis?  Because math says someone is 60% likely to do something?  80% likely?  Where do we draw the line?

This comes up today because I read an article about [Static-99](http://www.static99.org/) and how it is being used to lock people away in asylums.  The statistics around the test, like a lot of things, are highly open to interpretation and being presented in whatever way suites your needs.  It is being abused and used to violate due process.

I highly recommend doing some research on it.  It is getting scary out there with the level of power that our government now wields against us, its citizens...
