Being a personal blog, sometimes you get a small view into my life that is not professional or technical. It doesn't happen often. This past Sunday was mother's day. I don't actually know my mom, my parents were divorced shortly after I was born and my dad had full custody. As an infant I received a letter or two from her but nothing since. 

I am in my forties now and when I google myself, I find I am easy to find online. Which leads to questions like why I haven't been found by her.

So anyways, Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there. And a further happy Mother's Day to my own mom that I don't know, Yukiko Nakamori...
