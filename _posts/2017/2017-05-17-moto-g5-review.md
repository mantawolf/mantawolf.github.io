For the past few years, I switched from using contract phones from major carriers to using more inexpensive phones without a contract on less major carriers. The current phone I have been using is the [Motorola G5 Plus](https://www.motorola.com/us/products/moto-g-plus). I have the version with 64GB of storage and 4GB of memory.

What can I say? This is a great phone for the price. Fairly speedy and switches between applications quickly. I added a 64GB micro sd card to it for music and such. I use the camera but not often. The pictures are good enough, some of the pictures from [Japan]({{ site.baseurl }}/japan-trip) in an earlier post were taken with the phone.

So the problem with a lot of Android phones is the carrier overlays that make the phone suck. The Moto overlays are very minimal and add to the phone. I can lay it face down and it automatically silences everything except alarms, can chop to enable the flash, and shake to turn on the camera. There are a few others but those are the ones I use all the time.

All in all, I highly recommend this phone. It costs next to nothing as far as smartphones go. And I pay less on my phone bill for it since its not a lease or contract.

As far as my carrier, I switch to T-Mobile. My total bill is not $160, after taxes and everything. That is for 4 lines with unlimited data, text, and calling. That also includes being able to tether my laptop to use the internet when I need to. Suck it AT&T and Verizon.
