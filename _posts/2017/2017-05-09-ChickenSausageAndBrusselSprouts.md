Ingredients
+ 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved (or quartered if very large)
+ 5 medium shallots, peeled and quartered
+ 1 lemon, thinly sliced into rounds, seeds discarded
+ 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
+ Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
+ 3 medium cloves garlic, minced or grated
+ 1½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
+ 1½ tablespoons honey
+ 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
+ 3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary needles (from about 5 sprigs)
+ 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1½ pounds)
+ 4 large Italian sausages (about 1½ pounds total), hot or sweet, cut into 2-inch lengths

Instructions
1. Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 450°F.
2. Combine Brussels sprouts, shallots, and lemon with 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet. (Alternatively, you can use a rimmed baking sheet.) Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to coat.
3. In a small bowl, combine garlic, mustard, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir to form a paste. Rub paste all over chicken. Nestle chicken and sausage pieces on top of Brussels sprouts.
4. Roast on lower rack until Brussels sprouts are browned and tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into coolest part of the chicken registers at least 165°F, 25 to 30 minutes. (If chicken and sausage are done before sprouts have browned enough, you can transfer the meat to a plate and let the vegetables finish in the oven; recombine before serving.) 
5. Serve.
