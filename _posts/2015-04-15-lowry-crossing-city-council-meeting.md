[Lowry Crossing City Council Meeting 2015-04-14](http://www.lowrycrossingtexas.org/agendafiles/CC%20Agenda%204%2014%2015.pdf)

Quite the night, lots of interesting things going on.  There was a discussion about building out a sewer system along highway 380 in order to support commercial growth.  At this time, there is not a lot of information.  North Texas Municipal Water District has said the corridor along 380 would be best based on elevation and such for such a system.  The intent is to support this sewer system with grants and such, and matching funds from NTMWD, rather than taxes.  There is no current plan to implement this across the city, so don't get rid of that septic system yet.

Quite a few items on the agenda dealing with ordinances.  The city has made an effort to actually codify the ordinances and they will soon be online.  That is going to be great.  There was a verbal complaint about number of animals on an acre.  Animals were healthy and well cared for.  There was a formal complaint about the castle looking house off Bridgefarmer, it seems this isn't the first one.  City asked the previous attorney about it last time and there is nothing the city can do, although citizens in that neighborhood are free to pursue action without the city being involved.

Lastly was a long discussion on the roads.  Repairs have been approved across the board, this thankfully includes The Crossings.  The most interesting thing of the evening was the completion of Myrick Lane/CR400.  Princeton plans for this road to be a back way into Walmart.  A citizen with land in the area proposed that rather than continuing the fix the existing road where it connects to Bridgefarmer, that the city contribute those funds and he will match the rest towards building the road straight to Bridgefarmer.  This would eliminate the sharp curves in the road.  There was some discussion about the city needing to address the drainage along the existing route and whether people who have property backing upto the road would want it gone.  I liked the idea and the land owner wants to develop along the road.  This would bring in more housing in the area.

Last item of note, the sheriff's department ran a speed survey down Bridgefarmer.  Whoever you are doing 90MPH at night, that is slightly dangerous down that road...
