Repeat ad nauseam, "the rich need to pay their fair share of taxes."  How much is their fair share?  I suppose to understand how much their fair share is we should understand how much they pay today.  That way we have a baseline of how much is not enough.

|Percentage of Population|Percentage of Money Earned|Percentage of Federal Taxes|
|------------------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|Top 1%                  |19%                       |paid 37%                   |
|Top 5%                  |34%                       |paid 59%                   |
|Bottom 50%              |12%                       |paid 3%                    |

So the top 1% of earners in this country made 19% of the money and paid 37% of the Federal taxes.  The bottom 50% of earners made 12% of the money and paid 3% of the Federal taxes.  So now we know how much of the rich earners money is not enough.

Another way to parse the CBO data...

Top 20% of earners in the US paid 67.9% of the total Federal tax bill.
Bottom 20% of earners in the US paid .3% of the total Federal tax bill.

Yea, 3/10ths of a percent...

Another piece of important information is how much the top percentage earners actually make.  Again, we can use IRS public data for that information.

|Earning Percentage|Average Salary|
|------------------|-------------:|
|1%                |$380,354      |
|5%                |$159,619      |
|10%               |$113,799      |
|25%               |$67,280       |
|50%               |$33,048       |


Here is the link to the raw IRS data, read it and decide on your own how much is a fair share...

In the same way I would like to know what the ideal temperature for the Earth is, I would like to know how much is a persons fair share of the Federal tax bill.  Based on where I fall into those brackets, I think I am paying 3 peoples share of the bill...
