CA Senator Yee was sentenced today to a whopping 5 years in prison, of which he will barely serve 2 if any at all.  He plead guilty to racketeering. charges and gets to avoid an gun charges!

This is a senator that supported anti-gun bills and believed in gun control.  Keep in mind that this asshole was taking money to allow the smuggling of automatic weapons and explosives into the United States to a designated terrorist organization.

Gun control is about control, not guns.  There are 2 different law's, one for the people and one for our rulers.
