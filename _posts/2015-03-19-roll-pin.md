As most anyone who has assembled an AR-15 from parts can attest, some of the assembly is painful.  The roll pin is certainly one of those areas.  So why would they use a roll pin on any part of an AR-15 instead of just using a regular old pin?

The roll pin actually goes by the name spring pin normally.  It is actually a mechanical fastener.  It is designed to be larger than the opening in which is it going to be inserted.  The pin is designed to be compressed to fit into the opening.  That compression pushes out on the opening in order to hold the pin in place rather than just falling out.

There is of course a full page wikipedia article on this very topic.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_pin "Spring Pin")
