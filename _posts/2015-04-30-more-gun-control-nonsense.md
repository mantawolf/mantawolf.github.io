There is a proposal to make us safer that was introduced by Rep. DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat.  They are proposing a $2000 tax credit to turn in an assault rifle.  The same crap spewed from her mouth about how "assault weapons" are not about hunting or self defense, and they are designed for a battlefield.  Let us start by debunking this first and foremost.  There is no such thing as an assault weapon.  It is a made up term by the people who dislike firearms to apply to firearms that look scary.  I can also use an AR-15 for hunting.  30 rounds isn't even enough if I run into a herd of pigs, that are invasive, destructive, and dangerous.  They are extremely useful for defense.  What firearm isn't?  More importantly, the 2nd amendment is about protecting ourselves from the government, not hunting.  It is also laughable to call the AR-15 designed for a battlefield.  The M-16/M-4 that is designed for the battlefield is fully automatic.  An AR-15 isn't.  There are also plenty of rifles that fire larger rounds that are way more dangerous.  For instance, any hunting rifle is as or more dangerous than an AR-15.  The AR-15 fires a high speed .22 caliber bullet, not a high speed .30 caliber bullet like a large number of hunting rifles.

So why target the AR-15?  Because it is scary looking, there is no other reason.  Rifles in general are not used in crimes.  Of the 11,000 Americans killed with a firearm in 2012, only 322 were killed with a rifle.  That is less than 3%.  That is according to data straight from the FBI.  The FBI doesn't separate rifles into categories, so we can assume even less of those were by an AR-15 rifle.

### Center for American Progress

What a joke.  Progress?  The only progress this place is trying to make is in convincing people they shouldn't defend themselves.  They have a [study](https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CAP-Youth-Gun-Violence-report.pdf), and I am hesitant to call it that, that suggest there is a crisis of gun violence affecting our youth.  Progress would be not using the "who will think of the children" argument every change you get in order to play on emotiions of people rather than providing real facts so people can make up there own mind.  The also report that gun deaths will surpass traffic deaths for the millenial age group.  Sure, if you inflate your numbers to include things like suicide, negligence, police officer involved shootings, and gang violence.

+ According to the Department of Justice, between 1993 (18,253) and 2011 (11,101) the murder rate declined by 39%.
+ Homicides at school went from an average of 29 per year in the 1990s to an average of 20 per year in the 2000s.
+ [Gun crime](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/) dropped by 49% between 1993 and 2010.
+ The number of [mass shootings](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/mass-shootings-arent-on-the-rise.html) aren't on the rise where mass being at least 4 victims.  The trend doesn't change even if you say 3.
+ School shootings aren't above the levels that were seen in the 1990s.  And for some perspective on that there were 500 homicides in Chicago in 2012, roughly the same number in the 132,000 schools in the US over 20 years.

We will just leave those numbers here, make your own decisions.
