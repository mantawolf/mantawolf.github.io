The democratic lawmakers are at it again, giving money to study something that doesn't exist.  More big government and more lying in order to advance the team goal.  Senator Markey (D-Mass) is pushing to give $60 million to the CDC to study the epidemic of gun violence.

What epidemic?  The numbers from the FBI show that there is no epidemic.  All the numbers provided show that firearm violence is down over the last 20 years.  It doesn't seem to matter how you look at the numbers, firearm related violence is down.
