I recently spent some time browsing many websites to learn how to smoke a ribeye.  There is always a hesitation in trying something new, especially when ribeyes have gotten so expensive.  I bought 6 and it set me back over $70!  Certainly not something you want to screw up.  Thankfully my first time through and they came out beautifully minus one small detail.  Let me share my experiences with you, might convince you to try it youself or even provide some fire to try it if you are already interested.

I found that there is nothing complicated about this.  

First step is to get steaks.  There are plenty of articles on picking a good steak.  I like my cuts 1.25" thick.  They pick up the smoky flavor and come out closer to a medium rare to medium.  Dry rub the meat with seasoning, plain salt and pepper work fine or something like A-1 dry rub or my personal favorite, Stubbs dry rub for beef.  I don't do anything like brine or marinate.  Personally I find that dry rub adds to the flavor and marinades tend to not.

Next pick a wood.  I used hickory chunks to do mine.  You won't need to worry too much about smoke time if you use thicker or thinner cuts but final cook time may need to be adjusted.  My grill runs cool, so smoking temperature was closer to 150 degrees fahrenheit for an hour.

Once the meat has been smoked, you need to complete the actual cook process.  Heat your grill to 450 degrees fahrenheit.  My grill has 2 sides, smoker and gas.  You can use a broiler or even remove the meat and fire up some charcoal if you do not have a double sided grill.  You only want to cook the meat 3-4 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the other side.  **DO NOT** flip the meat more than that. 

That is it.  Serve it hot, don't let it sit and cool.
