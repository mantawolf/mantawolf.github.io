Today let us talk about basic driving knowledge people seem to of forgotten.

+ Use a blinker to signal lane changes and turns at least 100' before the approach to the turn
+ When someone uses a blinker, slow down and let them over (courtesy)
+ Maintain a safe distance between (defined as able to stop without causing an accident) vehicles based on speed and conditions
+ Slow down to 20mph below posted speed limit when passing an emergency vehicle with the lights on
+ Switching lanes over and over to get somewhere faster does NOT work, [Mythbusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZefgUVg3qx0) proved it
+ Trucks are required to properly secure a load
+ And the one we are getting to, when turning you are required to turn into the lane closest to the direction you are turning

The one that is getting on the wrong side of me lately is turning.  I have to make a left turn at an intersection at a light where everyone coming towards me is turning right as well.  The other drivers usually turn in the left hand lane, which is illegal.

> Sec. 545.101. TURNING AT INTERSECTION. (a) To make a right turn at an intersection, an operator shall make both the approach and the turn as closely as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.
