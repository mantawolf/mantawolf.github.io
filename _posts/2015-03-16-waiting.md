I used to live out in far east Dallas, county next to Dallas as a matter of fact, 2 cities into that county from Dallas.  When I would order something online and shipping would tell me what day to expect it, I could generally expect it between noon and 4PM.  I moved to the county north of Dallas, to a larger city and a place I would expect much faster deliveries.  Ordered some headphones from Amazon.com.  Shipping said today by 8PM.  Man they were **NOT** kidding.  It is 7:35PM and they still haven't arrived!

I hate waiting, I want my replicator already dang it.  But hey, once I get my headphones, I can do a proper review and all...
