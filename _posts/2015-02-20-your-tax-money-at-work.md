Ever heard of StingRay?  It is this great product made by Harris Corporation/Boeing.  It allows a person to setup a fake cell tower and intercept cellular data.  The FBI and the Police forces are using these.  How and why are they being used?  How often?  Against who?  Well we do not know the answer to that.  The FBI is telling police departments not to disclose that data AND they sign agreements to keep that data confidential.

Wait...  The government is doing things, that involve US citizens, with their tax money, and refuse to tell us what they have done?  As a veteran that flies in the face of everything I signed on to defend.  As a citizen of this great country, the people need to stand up and say "no" to the government over-stepping its boundries.

You can add to that a great piece of news barely making the rounds that US and UK spies hacked the servers of the largest SIM card manufacturer in the world and stole the encryption keys used on your communications.
