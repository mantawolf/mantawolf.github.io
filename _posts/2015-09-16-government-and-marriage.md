There certainly has been a lot about rights going on in the new lately.  A lot of the problems lately come from whether gay marriage violates the rights of religious people who have to perform ceremonies and bake cakes.  People are lining up and taking sides on both sides depending on who they believe is right.

I began thinking about this a while ago, before Kim Davis started to get her 5 minutes of fame.  This is a problem with big government, not rights.  My suggestion is that some state governments got it half right when they started allowing civil unions.  The concept of a marriage license should of been dissolved and they government should of started issuing civil union contracts to everyone.  This would be what a marriage license in the eyes of the government is, merely an agreement between people to share a life together and an intent to co-habitate.  You could call it a co-habitation agreement for all I care, just not a marriage license.

Marriage could of been left to the religious as a ceremony before their God to state their intentions and the government would not be embroiled in the mess it is today, trying to decide who's rights trump the other.  For the record, Kim Davis was not within her rights as an elected official to determine what rules she was going to follow and what ones she was going to ignore.
