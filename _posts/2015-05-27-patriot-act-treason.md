As Ben Franklin said, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."

Everyone I have met supports the Constitution, liberal and conservative. Most people agree that the Founding Fathers of our country were smart men and wrote the document well enough to be applicable then and now. Yet the past few presidents have discarded that document, that document that defines us as a Nation, in favor of security theater. The worst offender here is the USA PATRIOT Act.  This act is far from being patriotic.

*** Amendment 1

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to impose a gag order, National Security Letters, that prevent you from disclosing that you are being investigated.  In the case of a third party holding data, it prevents them from telling their customers/users that there is an investigation involving them.

*** Amendment 4

> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

The USA PATRIOT Act has allowed the government to seize data about you with no warrant, they merely have to suggest an association to terrorism. Agents can seize your electronic devices at the border without a warrant. Agents can search your phone and internet records with no warrant and without even informing you of that search.

So they need no warrant, no oversight, no declaration of what is being searched for, and no notice that you are being searched.

*** Amendment 6

> In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the unlawful detainment of American citizens for an indefinite time period with no trial or legal consul. It allows for the monitoring of conversations between your attorney and you. You can be jailed without confronting your accuser. If you are labeled an enemy combatant, you can be jailed without any communication to anyone you know and refused an attorney.  You will just disappear.

*** USA PATRIOT Act

**U**niting and **S**trengthening **A**merica by **P**roviding **A**ppropriate **T**ools **R**equired to **I**ntercept and **O**bstruct **T**errorism Act of 2001

This "act" has done nothing to make us safer, it has let the enemy win by reducing the rights of the people of the United States.  We of course can not even prove how effective the act has been since everything that has been passed has allowed for reduced oversight and the supression of information regarding it.  In the name of security and making sure we are safe, we can not know how our government is protecting us and how often the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act have been used for or against us.

Any politician that supports this atrocity is an enemy of the state and should be tried for treason.
